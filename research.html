            <p class="pastlife"> My current research interests encapsulate questions around human-computer interaction and new methods in human rights open-source investigations. 
                I am also interested in exploring questions on transparency and fairness in reinforcement learning systems as a part of the broader topic of AI ethics.

                As a part of the Division of Computing, Data Science, and Society and Human Contexts and Ethics team I am researching on affective computing & publics and emotional public sphere in context-aware computing. 
                My recent project was on the recognition of emotion categories through semantic and acoustic structure of the voice with deep learning models. Research on the emerging implications of emotional tech included STS ethnography and actor-network mapping to deconstruct and understand the role of structural mechanisms of power and sociotechnical system in the production of the deep learning models to generate an objective class of data: human emotional and mental states.
                My research advisors are Ari Edmundson and Margo Boenig-Liptsin.

                With Berkeley Center of New Media and Human Rights Center under Berkeley Law School 
                I am interested in researching how new methods and techniques such as advanced satellite imagery, 
                spatial and architectural analysis, machine learning image pattern analysis, 3D modeling, open-source documentation, 
                and data visualization for storytelling can be applied in investigative cases on human rights violations, war crimes, and crimes against humanity.
