                I am researching simplified cursor control with gesture control and recognition at Brian Barsky's Computer Vision Lab 
                as well as generating archival maps with GAN models at Clancy Willmot's Research Group to better understand human mapmaking process, cartographic representations, and more.

                As a part of the Division of Computing, Data Science, and Society and Human Contexts and Ethics team I am researching on affective computing & publics and emotional public sphere in context-aware computing. 
                My recent project was on the recognition of emotion categories through semantic and acoustic structure of the voice with deep learning models. Research on the emerging implications of emotional tech included STS ethnography and actor-network mapping to deconstruct and understand the role of structural mechanisms of power and sociotechnical system in the production of the deep learning models to generate an objective class of data: human emotional and mental states.
                My research advisors are Ari Edmundson and Margo Boenig-Liptsin.

                With Berkeley Center of New Media and Human Rights Center under Berkeley Law School 
                I am interested in researching how techniques in computer vision and other methods can be applied for investigative reconstructions of human rights violations, war crimes, and crimes against humanity in different contexts (i.e. legal, journalism).
