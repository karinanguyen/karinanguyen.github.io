        <p class='main-text'> <span style="background-color: #F5E977">Traces of violence</span> in war crimes is a
            process that is non-linear, but they are inevitably kinetically projected on the built environment. The
            patterns of violence can be observed
            from different <span style="background-color: #F5E977">scales</span>: spatial traces on the whole area of
            the conflict, urban deformations of neighborhoods / human communities, and architectural effects on
            buildings from their interaction with objects of violence (missiles, tear gas, barrel bombs). In this way,
            <a style="font-style:italic;"> the process itself becomes the form. </a>
        </p>

        <p class='main-text-1'>
            The objective of this project is to visually narrate one of ways perpetrators choose <span
                style="background-color: #F5E977">architectural destruction</span> as a means to exercise power across
            different sociopolitical contexts as well as how power as a process transforms into its own form.

        </p>

        <p class='main-text-1'>
            <span style="background-color: #F5E977">Power</span> is rather an abstract term — it takes on many different
            forms, from ideological to psychological, physical and political. I am exploring those manifestations on
            architectural buildings as the way to argue that <strong>buildings are becoming historical documents and
                function as devices of memory and change.</strong>
            They store information in its deformations and respond to external sensors, reflecting sociopolitical
            tensions.
            The effect of barrel bombs on the building is different from the effect of drone missiles. Each <span
                style="background-color: #F5E977">deformation</span> in the building is a unique signature of its
            interaction with the object of violence, preserving the effect of the change and acting as memory.
            As the derivative of architectural destructions, spatial separation becomes a tool to control hierarchy and
            power.
        </p>

        <p class='main-text'>
            I start with <span style="background-color: #F5E977">satellite imagery</span> because it visually offers
            similar viewpoints on architectural structures before and after acts of violence. The implied discord of
            temporal before-and-after imagery also suggests current politics of image resolution, access, and limitation
            of date and time choice. I then created some 3D models from satellite imagery to visually represent
            deformation in urban fabric when whole neighborhoods get destroyed.
            This project is still a work in progress as I am building up new visual approaches and collecting more data.

    <p class="paragraph">
        Architectural <span style="background-color: #cac1e7">space</span> becomes a critical technology of political
        control. We've seen this in times of totalitarian regimes, where architecture was one of the means to strengthen
        their international reputation.
        They seem to be in competition with each other and with the whole world, trying to <span
            style="background-color: #cac1e7">construct</span> buildings-champions: the highest skyscraper, the most
        spacious stadium, or at least the most beautiful pavilion in the international exhibition. Conversely, in crimes
        against humanity and war crimes it is the destruction and <span style="background-color: #cac1e7">deconstructive
            narrative</span> of urban spaces that establishes power
        over human communities and the environment.

        Situating architectural scale in context of military conflict, the analogous pattern of power is <span
            style="background-color: #cac1e7">the scale of destructions</span> and the importance of overtaken building
        types. The ideological power is expressed by occupying buildings that function for <span
            style="background-color: #cac1e7">educational, media, and religious purposes</span> as you can see in this
        set of images. 
        Attacking these buildings, perpetrators establish a long-term strategy for a political control in the area,
        disseminating propaganda campaigns, involving young people to the recruitment, and initiating training programs.

        These mosques and universities are large as they were constructed to accomodate the public. Ideological power
        suggests not only spatial erasure in maps, but also <span style="background-color: #cac1e7">erasure in human
            memory</span> of the places that in turn redefines their personal relationship with those spaces.
        We see here how spatial manipulation is manifested through architectural size. Later on, we will see how it is
        also manifested through distance and scale.

        Alfred North Whitehead, a mathematician and philosopher, once said that reality is made of
        processes rather than independent material objects constructed by bits of matter, and that <span

        becomes the outcome of such processes.

    <p class='subtitle'> Methodology & Remarks. </p>

    <div class="section-1">
        <p class="main-text-3">
            While architecture offers the lens to critique sociopolitical climate, deconstruction in visual
            counterforensics becomes a tool to restore memory from geometric shapes and human mind. I am reminded by
            this quote, <a style="font-style:italic;">"Deconstruction must through a double gesture, a double science,
                put into practice a reversal of classical opposition and a general displacement of the system. It is on
                that condition alone that deconstruction will provide the means of intervening in the field of
                oppositions it criticizes and which is also a field of non-discursive forces."</a>(Marges)
        </p>

        <p class="main-text-3">
            The history of geometry is founded on the assumption of memorylessness. But what open-source visual
            investigative practice teaches is that it can store effects of past actions and thus has the notion of
            memory.
            A shape of objects such as buildings is the medium of reconstructing history through a study of deformations
            and inferences, unfolding forensic information. Eyal Weizman once said, "Histories of violence will always
            have their lacunas and discontinuities."
            I think it is most visible when using satellite imagery. Not only is it because of gradual disappearance of
            human scale and more accurate details with higher zoom levels, but also because of the politics of pixel
            resolution, access to high quality imagery, and corporate ownership of satellites.
            This affects time choices as well as places as it is seen in the project.
        </p>

        <p class="main-text-3">
            Counter-cartographic practice grows from the a long tradition of post-colonial practices of mapping back.
            Like maps, satellite imagery today is a tool that can be used to reconstruct reality, detect invisible
            violence, and hold power accountable.
            In visual investigations, it is architectural satellite imagery that becomes a "form of cartography" to spot
            urban violence performed in war crimes. (Eyal Weizman)

            teaching me satellite imagery analysis, and Linus Lee for feedback and coding help. This project would have
            never been possible without my experience and learnings at Human Rights Center and UC Berkeley.
